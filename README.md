## Set it up

To set everything up you just need to follow these simple steps:

* Clone the repository.
* Make sure you have **make** and the latest version of **Node JS** installed.
* Run ```make``` to build the assets.

If you don't have make you can also build the assets by issuing the following commands:

```
$ npm install -qs
$ npm run build
```

This will build the assets (CSS and JavaScript) in ```assets/bundle```.

## Development

For development there is a watch task that will automatically update the asset bundle when you make any changes. To start the watch task just run ```make watch``` or run ```npm run watch``` if you don't have make installed.

## Status

This project is still at its earliest development phase. More info will follow.
